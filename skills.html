            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <div class="box">
                <p><sup>1</sup> Nature has always fascinated me, and one of my favorite hobbies is nature watching.
                    <sup>2</sup> I enjoy observing the beauty of trees, rivers, and wildlife, especially when I visit parks or go on hiking trips.
                    <sup>3</sup> There’s something peaceful about listening to birds chirping and watching leaves sway in the wind.
                    <sup>4</sup> Aside from nature, I also have a strong interest in technology, particularly in new computer hardware.
                    <sup>5</sup> I frequently watch tech-related videos to stay updated on the latest processors, graphics cards, and other components.
                    <sup>6</sup> Another hobby I enjoy is mountain biking, which combines my love for nature and adventure.
                    <sup>7</sup> Riding through rough trails, feeling the wind rush past, and conquering steep paths give me a sense of excitement and accomplishment.
                    <sup>8</sup> I also have a passion for astrophotography.
                    <sup>9</sup> Capturing the night sky, especially distant galaxies and nebulae, amazes me every time.
                    <sup>10</sup> I love setting up my camera and telescope on clear nights, waiting patiently to take detailed shots of celestial objects.

            <div class="box">
                <p><sup>1</sup> I have a strong interest in modifying computers and automobiles, especially JDM cars.
                    <sup>2</sup> Customizing computers has always been exciting for me, whether it's upgrading components, improving cooling systems, or optimizing performance.
                    <sup>3</sup> I enjoy researching the latest hardware, overclocking processors, and experimenting with RGB lighting to create unique builds.
                    <sup>4</sup> Building a PC from scratch gives me a sense of satisfaction, knowing that every part is carefully chosen for maximum efficiency.
                    <sup>5</sup> Similarly, I have a passion for modifying cars, particularly JDM vehicles.
                    <sup>6</sup> I admire their sleek designs, high-performance engines, and the rich car culture behind them.
                    <sup>7</sup> Styling JDM cars is an art, from selecting the right body kits and spoilers to installing custom wheels and suspension systems.
                    <sup>8</sup> Watching videos about car modifications and learning about different tuning techniques keeps me inspired.
                    <sup>9</sup> The thrill of working on machines, whether a computer or a car, gives me a deep sense of accomplishment.
                    <sup>10</sup> Both hobbies allow me to express creativity and technical skills while pushing the limits of engineering.
